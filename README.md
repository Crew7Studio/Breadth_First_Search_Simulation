## This algorithm can be used in Tower Defense games  for Enemy AI to find shortest path between two points

This Unity project uses  Breadth First Search algorithm to find the shortest path between 2 points.

BFS is an algorithm to find the shortest path between two points. 

<br/>

### HOW TO USE :
Set the transform of START and END point on the script attached to the Node gameobject and press play button. The Player/Enemy will spawn at the starting point and move towar the end point, through the path generated by the BFS algorithm. ( Look in the Youtube video provided ) <br/>
<br/>

### TOOLS USED :
* Unity game engine<br/>
